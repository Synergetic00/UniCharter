Our units are therefore strongly student-centred, and focus on developing students' abilities and skills, not just instilling knowledge.\nMost units combine theoretical and practical components. Theoretical components are taught using a combination of lectures, tutorials, workshops and online activities. Practical components involve laboratory-based sessions, field trips to locations on and around campus, in the Sydney Basin, and further afield, as well as role-play scenarios and problem-solving in tutorial sessions. A feature of many units is working in small or large groups, where students can develop the capacity to work with others in a team to achieve a goal. In recognition that students learn via different means (i.e. visual, auditory, tactile), many of our units take advantage of a diversity of media for their delivery (e.g. videos, lectures, readings, activities). Our philosophy is that students learn by doing and we endeavour to make our units as hands-on as possible.\nThe Biodiversity & Conservation degree is offered in external as well as internal mode. This means that for many units, instead of attending weekly practicals, students can opt to cover these in blocks over several weekends. Furthermore, many of the theoretical aspects can be completed on-line in lieu of lecture attendance. Note that the external offering is designed to maximize flexibility, but does not eliminate the face-to-face component.\nThe structure of the Bachelor of Biodiversity and Conservation allows students the opportunity to include a Participation and Community Engagement [PACE] unit where they can apply their skills in the real world in projects with partners outside the University.",

This includes helping you to learn what is required in each individual subject (unit), but also in the bachelor program as a whole. By successfully completing the various assessment tasks you will have satisfied the requirements of the course.\nWhen you complete the degree, you will have attained a wide variety of skills. The reason we can say this with confidence, is because of the assessment process. There are two major processes at work here, known as formative assessment and summative assessment. Both are important. Formative assessment aims to improve your learning, determining where you are having problems, and generally how to fix them. Examples of this type of assessment used in the program include quizzes, homework activities, assignments etc. The assessments in the course serve two functions; A) they facilitate your learning and B) after the successful completion assessments represent evidence that you have learnt the course content.\nSummative assessment allows the teaching staff - and ultimately you - to determine if you have achieved the learning outcomes for each unit. It assesses whether learning has taken place. Final examinations' written and practical - are one type of summative assessment that we use. The chiropractic program utilises a wide variety of assessment methodologies. Apart from the 'usual' types such as written assignments, class tests, laboratory reports and final examinations, there is also special attention given to tasks which assess your chiropractic technique. These tasks are distributed throughout each session, with different weighting assigned to them depending on whether they are used for formative or summative purposes. In anatomy, you will be given 'spot tests', which require you to identify structures on bones, models and cadavers.\nA part of the assessment process which is fundamental to your learning is feedback. This is where you are given information about your performance in your assessment tasks, and highlights topic areas on which you need to improve. It aims to help you achieve the competencies required in your studies. Feedback may be formal or informal, written or oral, individual or group based. As you progress through the program, assessment tasks require you to demonstrate progressive levels of competency. They are devised so we can determine how well you can apply your knowledge, analyse clinical scenarios, and demonstrate the acquisition of psycho-motor skills which can be used in the appropriate clinical context in future years.",

        "learningMethods": "During this program, you will be exposed to a number of different teaching methods which aim to facilitate your learning. These methods are not identical for each subject (called units), but essentially consist of varying combinations of lectures, practical classes and tutorials, plus set activities which you need to complete in addition to the face to face teaching sessions. The goal of the Bachelor of Chiropractic Science is to ensure that you complete the degree having attained a set of defined competencies (known at Macquarie University as 'Graduate Capabilities'). In order to develop these, every unit you study will utilise a specific combination of teaching methods which are most appropriate for that purpose.\nLectures in this degree largely aim to provide a framework upon which you can build further knowledge and skills. Tutorials usually provide the opportunity to enhance your understanding of specific topics, as well as allowing you to communicate with your peers, share opinions, and develop more complex ways of thinking. Practicals have many functions, depending on the subject area. Essentially, they will require that you apply your knowledge in a practical setting, and complement your 'thinking' with 'doing'.\nAnatomical sciences are studied in the 3 years of the program, incorporating lectures, tutorials and practical sessions. The practical sessions use a variety of resources, including anatomical models, skeletons, X-rays and cadavers. Learning human anatomy by seeing it in three dimensions is highly effective. Having the opportunity to 'feel' anatomical structures on living subjects is another invaluable method used in the teaching of these units.\nChiropractic Science units include lectures and practical classes. Much importance is placed on the latter, as it is here where you will develop your psychomotor skills, preparing you for higher level clinical training in the Master of Chiropractic degree. We also will provide you with specific times during each session during which you can practice your skills in a safe and supervised environment.\nIn some subjects, you will have the opportunity to become involved in 'peer assisted learning' programs, in which students who have recently completed a unit help current students with any problems that they may have in understanding the subject material.\nWhat you do 'outside' the formal classes, such as completing selected readings, completing specific exercises, and researching for assignments, is just as important. It is here that you develop your ability to acquire information from reliable sources, develop organisational and critical thinking skills, allow for self-reflection, and become a responsible learner, an essential requirement for life as a future health professional.",

Recognising that the videogames industry in Australia is small and jobs are hard to come by, we also intend to give graduates a wider variety of career options in software development and user experience design.\nThe BGDD program comprises three streams, addressing three different skill areas important for the field: 1. Software development. Videogames are complex pieces of software and their development requires all the skills of another other software development project, including programming, testing, and project management. 2. User experience (UX) design. Designing a videogame requires a solid understanding of how players interact with game systems and the experiences that result. This requires skills in UX design and analysis, and user-testing. 3. Critical theory. Games are a major media form of the 21st century, and an informed designer needs to understand the social context within which their games exist, including important ethical considerations around audience, representation and the psychological effects of gaming. This stream also emphasises literacy, communication skills and the ability to present a reasoned argument based on academic sources.",

Overall, the learning and teaching methods employed throughout the course reflect the breadth of the program and range from laboratory-based practical work through to sophisticated, reflective field-work, as represented in our 3rd-year Professional and Community Engagement (PACE) unit. The overarching pedagogical approach throughout the course is student-centred learning, with an emphasis, not simply on the acquisition of discipline knowledge, but also on the development of higher-order critical thinking and problem-solving approaches to a range of psychological processes and issues. Although units differ with respect to formal lecture offerings (including recorded lectures), there is a focus in every unit on small-group learning through laboratory practicals and/or tutorial exercises and discussions. Students are also encouraged to engage with iLearn discussions of lecture and tutorial material, and to test the development of their own understanding via online tests and quizzes. First-year psychology students are required to participate in Departmental research projects in order to learn how research is conducted and to encourage interaction with more senior scholars in the field.",

Students are expected to actively engage in their learning and work with their lecturers, tutors and fellow students to achieve these learning outcomes.\nLearning styles used in the BAppFin may include:\n<ul>\n<li>Case studies or simulations, which provide students with an opportunity to apply their knowledge to real or simulated scenarios in individual or group situations. </li>\n<li>Project work, which may be independent or involve group learning. Projects assist students in developing more in-depth knowledge and skills in conducting research, communication, and in planning, organisation and time management.</li>\n<li>Readings taken from textbooks, journals, websites and other sources provide material to further develop concepts and knowledge referred to in individual units in the program.</li>\n<li>Reflective activities, such as journals, which assist students in integrating the course content and in developing the ability to transfer knowledge and skills from the learning environment into the workplace. </li>\n<li>Self-study activities, such as questions with worked examples, (non assessed) online quizzes, and textbook questions and answers.</li>\n<li>Online discussion forums, in which students may be required to submit responses to a given question, and/or to participate in a set discussion topic.</li>\n</ul>\nLearning in the BAppFin may be facilitated through the following teaching methods:\n<ul>\n<li>Lectures: lectures provide insight into key concepts and understanding of the subject matter pertaining to a unit of study. Extensive use is made of the Echo 360 lecture audio recording system, and lectures may also be video captured. This means that students can usually access lecture material, in some format, on an 'on demand' basis. </li>\n<li>Tutorials: tutorials are classes in which a tutor facilitates interactive learning with a small group of students. In first year, tutorials tend to focus on ensuring that fundamental concepts and skills are acquired. As students progress on to units at a higher level, the focus shifts towards a more critical engagement with the discipline. </li>\n<li>Computer lab workshops or Practicals: the environment in which our graduates will work is one requiring high level quantitative skills. These quantitative skills are developed, in part, in computer lab workshop sessions. These sessions allow students to acquire and practice quantitative skills that are highly valued in the workplace. In addition to formal workshop sessions under the direct instruction of a lecturer or tutor, students are able to access the labs to practice skills and to complete assessment tasks in their own time. </li>\n<li>PACE (Professional and Community Engagement) is Macquarie University's way of connecting students with partner organisations to provide a mutually beneficial experience. The BAppFin PACE unit, AFIN3010 Issues in Applied Finance takes the form of engagement with industry professionals from various industries including financial planning, investment consulting firms, construction companies who work with the unit convenor is developing hands on projects and assignments for students. These projects are based on what would be expected of a student in their first year of work. In a typical semester practitioners deliver 6 to 8 hrs lectures on campus based on specialised topics which demonstrate and discuss the skills required in completing projects in these areas. Students are then given projects some of which are completed in groups and individually. </li>\n<li>PAL sessions: the Faculty of Business and Economics also offers PAL (Peer Assisted Learning) workshops in a number of first and second year units. The free, weekly PAL workshops are led by trained students who have excelled in those particular units, and are open to all enrolled students in these units. The purpose of PAL is to promote improved learning and understanding of the unit's content in a group setting.</li>\n</ul>",

The learning and teaching methods that students will encounter are matched to the content of each unit and students can expect to engage in online lectures, tutorials, small and large group learning activities, and skill development training, all of which will require their active participation. Learning and teaching materials are routinely delivered using multimodal resources.\nThe academic curriculum is structured sequentially so that students gain knowledge across the range of Speech Pathology practice by the end of Year 1 (i.e., 80cp). In Year 2 there is increased emphasis on case complexity, and systematic development towards Speech Pathology Australia's required levels of knowledge and competence for graduates entering the profession.\nThe clinical practicum curriculum is structured to include two types of placements, i.e., those that are one day per week (session placements), and those that are several days per week (block placements). The session placements continue throughout each session, and mean that students will learn concurrently in their coursework and clinical practice units. This structure is designed to foster students' abilities to think critically, gain insight into the clinical relevance of theoretical frameworks and research findings, and develop ability to integrate insights from clinical experiences during classroom-based learning activities with peers. The block placements allow students to learn in clinical settings on a daily basis, offering opportunities to apply and consolidate skills and knowledge in settings that closely approximate everyday speech pathology practice.\nCritical engagement with a variety of perspectives is encouraged during learning activities through the participation of clinical researchers, specialist clinicians, and people with communication disabilities and/or their family members. These practices foster the teamwork and networking required for successful work within the Speech Pathology profession, as well as making learning experiences enjoyable and productive.",

The majority of assessments are based on the submission of individual coursework in the form of essays, assignments, and practical reports. All units have formal examinations which form a significant part of the assessment of student achievement, and which is where a student's ability to apply knowledge is assessed. Assessment types are diverse across units and may include written (scientific reports, essays, project proposals, case studies, critiques of papers from the current scientific literature) or oral (seminars, debates, discussions) or other forms of multimedia (quizzes, poster presentation, digital media presentations, blogs, wikis). Several units incorporate continuing assessment tasks as a small part of the overall assessment; these typically take the form of submission of written questions after each week's lecture, which are then discussed at the start of the following week's lecture. This provides excellent reinforcement for learning of difficult concepts.\nClear standards and criteria for all coursework, what is assessed and how it is assessed, are contained in each unit guide. The program incorporates both formative and summative feedback.Formative feedback is received while working on a task; summative feedback is received once a task has been completed and submitted for assessment. Both forms of feedback are extremely important and provide students with information and guidance on their development and progress. Feedback is mostly provided in written form and occasionally in discussion with peers, tutors and academic advisors. In laboratory practical environments, formative feedback is an essential part of the learning experience, and students 'learn from doing' exactly how to conduct experiments which produce meaningful results.",

The core content is centered mainly around biochemistry and molecular biology. Practical laboratory sessions constitute a major part of the learning experience. Students will learn how to conduct experiments in a real laboratory environment, and be able to employ the theoretical knowledge they have developed. Most units use a tutorial or workshop format to help reinforce concepts that have already been delivered, and allow for greater student engagement in problem-based learning.\nThe majority of information is delivered by face-to-face lectures. However, there is some flexibility within this because most lectures are recorded and are hence accessible online after they have been initially delivered. This is especially useful for part-time students who may be juggling work and study schedules. Considerable effort is made to keep teaching practices interesting and engaging for students. Much of the science involved is a fairly rapidly developing field, so lectures and tutorials need to be reformulated each year to take into account recent developments. In addition to this, a wide variety of teaching practices are used. As examples, students in core units in this program are asked to build models of protein structures, prepare protein extracts from interesting plant samples they have collected themselves and participate in debates based on relevant issues.\nGrad Diploma students will learn to communicate concepts in biotechnology and related sciences in various forms, such as oral presentations, essays, practical reports, and more. The majority of these are individual tasks, while some are done in small groups. An ethics based unit is offered recommended as there are numerous ethical issues intertwined with developments in modern biotechnology. Lastly, students are required to become familiar with modern scientific literature, including reading, summarising and presenting scientific papers, and preparing written work in formats used in scientific publications.",

The array of formats in which lectures are available ensures that students have access to the lecture materials at any point during the semester.</li>\n<li>Tutorials: Tutorials provide an opportunity for students to critically engage with the selected topic(s). Tutorials provide three key markers: First, they provide forums for resolving uncertainties within and questions about the set materials and topics. Second, tutorial participation generates knowledge. Through tutor-led and peer-assisted direction, students generate knowledge of the subject. Third, tutorials enable students to put generated knowledge into practice through activities such as discussion, debate, group tasks and presentations. Additionally, the knowledge generated in tutorials underpins assessment structures and tasks.</li>\n<li>Workshops: Production units within the course utilise workshops in which students develop production skills such as genre writing, video editing or coding with a JavaScript framework. Guided workshops enable students to generate knowledge and apply it to an individual or group production such as a piece of music journalism or trans-media project spanning radio, screen production and web design offerings.

Assessment in this program thus serves to ensure both theoretical and practical competency has been achieved.\nThe chiropractic program utilizes a wide variety of assessment methodologies that serve to achieve the clinical competencies set by the accreditation body - The Council on Chiropractic Education Australasia (CCEA). - Classical assessments that are used include written assignments, class tests, and final examinations.\nHowever, particular attention is given to tasks which assess the diagnostic and clinical capabilities that you will have developed over the course of the program. - These clinical skills are assessed using Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs)\nYour clinical internship in the final year of the Master of Chiropractic has several competency-based assessments that are designed to evaluate your development as a healthcare practitioner. These assessments also provide evidence that you are accumulating the necessary clinical experience to function safely and effectively in the healthcare workforce. - You will show evidence of your acquisition of these competency-based skills through the development of a clinical competency portfolio.\nThere are several opportunities to present cases and research material, which develop necessary skills in communication and presentation that are essential to working in a multidisciplinary healthcare team or environment.\nAn adjunct to the assessment process is feedback about your performance in your various assessment tasks. This information can be used to highlight areas that require improvement as well as provide you with the framework by which to calibrate your performance against your peers or against previous personal performances.

The majority of assessments are based on the submission of individual coursework in the form of essays, assignments, and practical reports. Some units have mid-semester examinations and all units have formal examinations which form a significant part of the assessment of student achievement, and which is where a student's ability to apply knowledge is assessed. Assessment types are diverse across units and may include written (scientific reports, essays, project proposals, case studies, critiques of papers from the current scientific literature) or oral (seminars, debates, discussions) or other forms of multimedia (quizzes, poster presentation, digital media presentations, blogs, wikis). Several units incorporate continuing assessment tasks as a small part of the overall assessment; these typically take the form of submission of written questions after each week's lecture. This provides excellent reinforcement for learning of difficult and various concepts. Clear standards and criteria for all coursework, what is assessed and how it is assessed, are contained in each unit guide and are reiterated during lectures or practical sessions. The program incorporates both formative and summative feedback. Formative feedback is received while working on a task; summative feedback is received once a task has been completed and submitted for assessment. Both forms of feedback are extremely important and provide students with information and guidance on their development and progress. Feedback is mostly provided in written form and occasionally in discussion with peers, tutors and academic advisors. In laboratory practical environments, formative feedback is an essential part of the learning experience, and students 'learn from doing' exactly how to conduct experiments which produce meaningful results.",

The core content is centred mainly around biochemistry and molecular biology. Practical laboratory sessions constitute a major part of the learning experience across the participating units. Students will learn how to conduct experiments in a laboratory environment, and be able to employ the theoretical knowledge they have developed in the experiments. Most units use a tutorial or workshop format to help reinforce concepts that have already been delivered, and allow for greater student engagement in problem-based learning. The majority of information is delivered by face-to-face lectures. Lectures are recorded and are hence accessible online, after they have been initially delivered, for those students who are not attending the lectures. This is especially useful for part-time students who may be juggling work and study schedules. Considerable effort is made to keep teaching practices interesting and engaging for students. As biotechnology is moving forward fast, especially the lectures need to be reformulated each year to take into account recent developments. In addition to this, a wide variety of teaching practices are used. As examples, students in core units in this course are asked to build models of protein structures, prepare protein extracts from interesting plant samples they have collected themselves, participate in debates based on relevant issues, and prepare short films presenting data from recent scientific papers. Biotechnology students will learn to effectively communicate concepts in biotechnology and related sciences in various forms, such as oral presentations, poster presentations, essays, practical reports, and more. The majority of these are individual tasks, while some are done in small groups. An ethics based unit is included in the course, since there are numerous ethical issues that need to be discussed with developments in modern biotechnology. Lastly, students are required to become familiar with modern scientific literature, including reading, summarising and presenting scientific papers, and preparing written work in formats used in scientific publications.",

In many assignments, students are required to show an ability to engage with the existing research literature on the topic at hand.\nAnother form of assessment is participation in online discussions (see 'Learning and Teaching Methods' above), as an ability to engage collaboratively and cooperatively with issues and problems relevant to the area of study is a key graduate capability. Quizzes (usually online) are used in some parts of the course to check understanding of key concepts.\nIn the practicum unit, students are observed in a teaching role, and their performance in this role is a key element of the assessment.\nThroughout the course, assignments and other forms of assessment are spaced so that students receive formative feedback during each semester which they can use in approaching later assessment tasks.",

        "learningMethods": "The Master of Applied Linguistics and TESOL degree course aims to train its graduates to become applied linguists who demonstrate a keen awareness of language as it is used in a variety of social and professional settings. Students are therefore trained to develop and apply skills in the observation, critical analysis and evaluation of language in context. Furthermore, they are expected to be able to engage with research in a range of sub-disciplines of applied linguistics, as well as formulating their own research questions in areas of individual interest. A particular focus of the course concerns the teaching and learning of English and a second or foreign language. The learning and teaching methods used in the delivery of the Master of Applied Linguistics reflect these broad aims, as well as the specific course learning outcomes. The exact learning and teaching methods vary from one unit to another, but the following patterns are typical.\nThroughout the course, students will learn through guided and reflective reading of textbooks, monograph chapters, and scholarly journal articles. This reading will generally be guided by pre-reading tasks/activities, and followed by reflective post-reading tasks/activities. Where students are undertaking a unit internally, such tasks will typically be part of face-to-face lecture-workshop sessions on campus, while external students will access them through an online learning interface. Online activities include reflection questions and self-assessment quizzes. Extensive reading is expected when students prepare assignments, and initial assignments in many of the units of the course help students to develop skills in working with the research literature in the different branches of applied linguistics and TESOL.\nTeacher-fronted classroom learning will form part of most units, but will typically be interspersed with individual, group and class activities that enable students to engage with and apply the material as they encounter it. The on-campus sessions are recorded so that they can be reviewed later by internal students, and also accessed by external students. Where face-to-face sessions do not lend themselves to recording (e.g. when the sessions are largely task or discussion based), alternative modes of material delivery are made available to external students. These include podcasts, recorded mini-lectures, written course notes and self-explanatory presentation slides.\nCollaborative discussion and problem-solving is also a key element of the Master of Applied Linguistics and TESOL course. When a unit is studied internally, many of these discussions take place in lecture-workshop sessions. External students interact through online discussion boards, as well as through e-mail contact with teaching staff. For many internal and external unit offerings, online discussion participation is a formal component of the assessment.\nAn optional practicum unit forms part of this program. Here, students are expected to translate their knowledge into pedagogical practice, for which they receive both formative and summative feedback from experienced English language teaching practitioners. Students have the option of completing a unit on evaluating language classroom practice in place of the practicum, depending upon their career plans.",

They provide opportunities for discussion and active engagement, and will draw not only on textbooks and online learning materials, but involve exposure and interaction with current research.\nTutorials demonstrate concrete applications of techniques introduced in lectures, and also provide a training ground for students to apply their knowledge. Tutorials typically involve a mixture of individual and group work with guidance and assistance from the tutors.\nPractical work is an indispensable part of the program. You will acquire familiarity with computational methods and practices that both illustrate the theoretical concepts that are presented in lectures and facilitate development of practical research and application skills. These classes are the first setting where you learn to work collaboratively, and preparation of reports from practical exercises provides you with valuable training in communicating scientific results.\nIn recognition that students learn via different means (i.e. visual, auditory, tactile), many of our units take advantage of a diversity of media for their delivery (e.g. videos, lectures, readings, activities). Our philosophy is that students learn by doing and we endeavour to make our units as hands-on as possible.\nMastering effective communication is a major component of all learning activities. Apart from the reports and problem-solving assignments you will prepare oral and written presentations and/or essays of your research and study projects.",

Our course therefore strongly encourages self-directed learning, focussing on developing students' abilities and skills, and not just instilling knowledge.\nOur units combine both theoretical and practical aspects. Theoretical elements are taught using a combination of lectures, tutorials, workshops and online activities. Practical components involve laboratory-based sessions and field trips, as well as role-play scenarios and problem-solving in tutorial sessions. The use of case studies in lectures and tutorials is an important component, demonstrating the application of theory and research tools to real-world problems in biological conservation. Teamwork is a common feature of practical exercises, where students can develop the capacity to work with others in a team to achieve a goal. In recognition that students learn via different means (i.e. visual, auditory, tactile), many of our units take advantage of a diversity of media for their delivery (e.g. videos, lectures, readings, activities). Our philosophy is that students learn by doing and we endeavour to make our units as hands-on as possible.\nThe degree is offered in external as well as internal mode. For external mode, instead of attending weekly classes, students complete practical exercises in blocks over several weekends, or by self-directed exercises from their home location. Furthermore, many of the theoretical aspects can be completed on-line in lieu of lecture attendance. Note that the external offering is designed to maximise flexibility, which is especially important to postgraduate coursework students, but does not eliminate the face-to-face component.\nEngagement with the latest research in conservation biology is an important component of the course. The latest developments in theory and research tools will be covered in lectures and tutorials, and case studies are used to demonstrate application to biological conservation. The development of research skills is built into the core coursework units of the course. Importantly, engagement with the conservation professional community is an essential element of the course.

In recognition that students learn via different means (i.e. visual, auditory, tactile), many of our units take advantage of a diversity of media for their delivery (e.g. videos, lectures, readings, activities). Our philosophy is that students learn by doing and we endeavour to make our units as hands-on as possible.\nThe degree is offered in external as well as internal mode. For external mode, instead of attending weekly classes, students complete practical exercises in blocks over several weekends, or by self-directed exercises from their home location. Furthermore, many of the theoretical aspects can be completed on-line in lieu of lecture attendance. Note that the external offering is designed to maximise flexibility, which is especially important to postgraduate coursework students, but does not eliminate the face-to-face component.\nEngagement with the latest research in conservation biology is an important component of the course. The latest developments in theory and research tools will be covered in lectures and tutorials, and case studies are used to demonstrate application to biological conservation. The development of research skills is built into the core coursework units of the course. Importantly, engagement with the conservation professional community is an essential element of the course.

The assessment includes a variety of written, presentation style and creative tasks designed to cater to a range of learning styles and strengths and to enhance existing skills.\nAssessment tasks are focused on application of discipline knowledge to professional practice in Indigenous Education settings, including researching and problem solving. Marking rubrics are given to students in advance of their assessments being due, to guide student expectation and learning. Core units require students to post written responses to weekly inquiry questions. These questions foster reflection and aim to integrate theory and practice, with a regular cycle of grade feedback and peer learning through open access to all student responses. Most assessment tasks encourage learners to apply developing theoretical knowledge and critical thinking skills, and judgement to their specific educational context. Assessment tasks focus student learning but are also designed to assess individual achievement against both unit level and course level learning outcomes.A range of assessment tasks are utilised, for example:\n<ul>\n<li>Research essays&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Digital storytelling</li>\n<li>Presentations for professional, general and Indigenous community audiences,</li>\n<li>Short written tasks requiring exercise of judgement and application of knowledge</li>\n<li>Research proposals</li>\n<li>Online Quizzes</li>\n</ul>\nWritten assessments encourage students to acquire, and further enhance their foundational knowledge as well to think critically about their Indigenous professional context and consider how to work effectively with Indigenous peoples and communities, in those contexts. The creative assessments (digital storytelling, ebook production for example) allow students to create resources for application in their classrooms, or other professional contexts, drawing on their theoretical knowledge but also fostering their growing sense of autonomy as advanced practitioners. Students in the final stages of the course develop a research proposal to address an issue they have identified from their own contexts. Learners peer review the proposal of one other student, and in turn receive peer feedback on their own proposal; an activity which requires students to evaluate, exercise judgement and consider their personal professional responsibility in relation to their classmate and the Indigenous community.",

They provide opportunities for discussion and active engagement, and will draw not only on textbooks and online learning materials, but involve exposure and interaction with current research.\nTutorials demonstrate concrete applications of techniques introduced in lectures, and also provide a training ground for students to apply their knowledge. Tutorials typically involve a mixture of individual and group work with guidance and assistance from the tutors.\nPractical work is an indispensable part of the program. You will acquire familiarity with computational methods and practices that both illustrate the theoretical concepts that are presented in lectures and facilitate development of practical research and application skills. These classes are the first setting where you learn to work collaboratively, and preparation of reports from practical exercises provides you with valuable training in communicating scientific results.\nIn recognition that students learn via different means (i.e. visual, auditory, tactile), many of our units take advantage of a diversity of media for their delivery (e.g. videos, lectures, readings, activities). Our philosophy is that students learn by doing and we endeavour to make our units as hands-on as possible.\nMastering effective communication is a major component of all learning activities.

Students are expected to attend tutorials prepared to answer and raise questions, interact with the tutor and with other students and, where appropriate to make group or individual presentations. \nCollaboration and discussion of issues is encouraged both in and out of the classroom. Online learning and collaboration provides an inclusive environment for external students.\nThe Department caters to a variety of learning styles and students will have the opportunity to learn through individual and collaborative study, discussion, debate, research, practical application, skills workshops, and self-directed methods.",

Macquarie University graduates will be doctors who capably practice quality medicine in diverse local and global communities, and effectively connect with patients and inter-professional teams across cultures.\n<strong>Mission</strong>The primary mission of the Medical course is to graduate doctors with the scientific, clinical, social and professional capabilities that will serve as the basis for medical practice across the world. By collaborating with domestic and international partners who share similar value sets, we will provide an outstanding clinical and educational experience locally and globally.\nOur primary mission will be realised through our commitment to:\n<ul>\n<li>Comparative and reflective approach to learning. We will use a comparative approach to the varied clinical, cultural and health system experiences of the course's diverse group of students. By encouraging reflection on these experiences, we will foster the achievement of an international perspective and a global capability set for our graduates.</li>\n<li>Patient-centred Care. We will graduate doctors who will make the quality of the care of patients their first concern, ensuring health care systems work well for their patients, and applying their knowledge and skills in a practical, professional and ethical manner. They will be practitioners focusing on quality, safety, efficiency, patient advocacy, and team-based care.</li>\n<li>Innovation. We will develop a course that focuses on the role of health systems in the provision of quality care, and on the emerging technologies that will be required for medical practice into the future.</li>\n<li>Cultural competence. We will prepare doctors who are aware of the impact of their own culture and values on their medical practice, and have knowledge of, respect for and sensitivity towards the cultural needs of diverse populations, including Indigenous people. The development of cultural competence will be embedded in the education process of the course.</li>\n<li>Research, and Science-based Practice. We will prepare graduates with research skills who understand how knowledge is discovered and applied, and who will lead the improvement of health and medical care through scholarship and research-informed practice.</li>\n</ul>",

The DPT teaching team is strongly committed to student-focussed and research-enhanced learning and teaching. Collectively, we are passionate about learning and teaching and view it as a crucial mechanism to enhance the quality of healthcare and facilitate the translation of research into evidence-based practice. Pedagogically, we use reflective practice and enquiry-based learning to ensure students become lifelong learners able to deliver evidence-based person-centred healthcare across the lifespan, which considers both restorative and preventative aspects of healthcare. A fundamental aspect of the pedagogy of the course is the semester by semester structure. This structure provides a logical, systematic flow through the course from start to finish and ensures progressive development towards attainment of the graduate capabilities and outcomes. The focus of the six semesters is outlined below:Semester A: Fundamental physiotherapy skillsSemester B: Managing common conditionsSemester C: Developing as a clinicianSemester D: Managing more complex conditionsSemester E: Extended knowledge of future leadersSemester F: Becoming an independent clinician and researcher.\nThe teaching team has a coherent philosophy utilising the World Health Organisation's International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health as the conceptual framework to underpin the students' development of clinical reasoning and skill acquisition research is used to shape their mastery of clinical physiotherapy skills. We have also embedded the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) Pain education curriculum within the course. We value authentic learning and teaching opportunities and provide clinically focussed tasks and activities to motivate and inspire our students. The team understands the power of assessment in driving learning, so our assessment tasks are highly authentic and innovative, some of which specifically add value for our clinical and research partners. We aim to inspire and motivate our students by establishing a strong student-focused learning and teaching culture.\nThe specialised teaching rooms were designed as authentic learning environments (e.g. a rehabilitation gym and a clinic room), which are equipped with state-of-the-art ICT, and physiotherapy equipment to engage and motivate students. These facilities also enable students to be co-producers or directors of their own learning by sourcing the latest research evidence or practice guidelines during classes. Our teaching and assessments use novel approaches, which simulate the real-world clinical setting as closely as possible. Our course also integrates clinical placements in both traditional and contemporary settings, including corporate organisations, public & private healthcare facilities, sporting bodies and within the community.",

There are Global Goals for Sustainable Development which provide a focus for policy, strategy and action by all countries and organisations. In 2018 Australia made its first report on the national and international actions undertaken for the Sustainable Development Goals in 2018. While Australia provides good case material for learning with good progress on many of the social development goals there are many challenges for the nation such as the rise of inequality and disadvantage, climate change, regional development in Australia, sustainable cities, and the continuing loss of biodiversity.\nDISTINCTIVE FEATURES OF THE MACQUARIE PROGRAM The Master of Sustainable Development has a strong focus on the importance of the quality of the environmental systems and ecological economics to support present and future social development. The core of the degree has a focus on how to effect changes towards sustainable development and to work with stakeholders with diverse perspectives and values and provides students with an option to hone skills to work with business and organisations on bringing about change for sustainability. The degree includes an Australian and international outlook through case studies, and exposes students to field work, practical examples of sustainability in Australia, and interaction with sustainability practitioners and a work practice experience as a consultant. The degree provides options for students to broaden or deepen capabilities in a diverse range of disciplinary options from the environment, economics, law, social science, business and  policy. The degree assists those who wish to integrate more sustainable thinking and innovation into their existing profession or who wish to change professions to be in a more ethically oriented field.",

Carefully scaffolded and sequenced assessment tasks are a feature encouraging regular practice and reinforcement of knowledge and skills and their integrated application. Modified development of content across assessments is also important to this course's methodology, with a view to systematic development of control over the learning outcomes.\nThe assessment regime is designed to account for both assessment of learning and assessment for learning. Online quizzes periodically test student control over foundational knowledge and skills. Evidence-based oral and/or written exercises provide both a process by which students can learn to integrate the foundational knowledge and skills and an opportunity to assess their competency in this area. Textual, documentary and material analyses and essays continue to assess foundational knowledge and historical skills. They also require students to put these skills to new uses by formulating arguments and applying their communicative and analytical skills creatively in a broader context.\nNaturally enough, this assessment regime encourages and rewards regular and systematic learning. Specific assessments also foster independent investigation, the development of research skills, and reflection on the significance of historical features and themes for the study of relevant ancient cultures. To this end, regular practice and revision of knowledge and skills are crucial. The course deploys early low-risk assessments, major research-based assessments, and final overview-assessments.",

They provide opportunities for discussion and active engagement, and will draw not only on textbooks and online learning materials, but involve exposure and interaction with current research.\nTutorials demonstrate concrete applications of techniques introduced in lectures, and also provide a training ground for students to apply their knowledge. Tutorials typically involve a mixture of individual and group work with guidance and assistance from the tutors.\nPractical work is an indispensable part of the program. You will acquire familiarity with computational methods and practices that both illustrate the theoretical concepts that are presented in lectures and facilitate development of practical research and application skills. These classes are the first setting where you learn to work collaboratively, and preparation of reports from practical exercises provides you with valuable training in communicating scientific results.\nIn recognition that students learn via different means (i.e. visual, auditory, tactile), many of our units take advantage of a diversity of media for their delivery (e.g. videos, lectures, readings, activities). Our philosophy is that students learn by doing and we endeavour to make our units as hands-on as possible.\nMastering effective communication is a major component of all learning activities. Apart from the reports and problem-solving assignments you will prepare oral and written presentations and/or essays of your research and study projects.\nToward the end of the program the Statistics project unit of study allows you to integrate your skills and knowledge, applied to real-life problems.",

Data Science is a multi-disciplinary area combining Statistics and Computational methods. The program includes a full year of preparatory units (6000 level) in both Statistics and Computing to mirror the Data Science Major in our BIT program. This provides students with the grounding in core topics required for advanced study in the second year. The advanced level unit are again drawn from both Statistics and Computing with four required units and two selected from an option set. These units cover statistical theory and practical computational methods such as machine learning and big data processing. This combination of skills and knowledge is the main requirement from industry for Data Scientists. The course is completed with a two-unit (20cp) capstone project that can be either an industry placement (internship) or internal research project. This allows students to gain experience working on real Data Science projects and, for appropriate students, direct exposure to industry problems and practices.\nStudents who complete certain core and advanced units in both Statistics and Computing can elect to exit with a Graduate Certificate of Data Science rather than complete the full Masters course.",

Scaffolded and sequenced assessment tasks are a feature, a quota of formal weighted tasks, and/or a final examination, encouraging regular practice and reinforcement of knowledge and skills and their integrated application.\nThe assessment regime is designed to account for both assessment of learning and assessment for learning. In-class or online quizzes periodically test student control over foundational knowledge and skills. Evidence-based oral and/or written exercises provide both a process by which students can learn to integrate the foundational knowledge and skills and an opportunity to assess their competency. Textual, linguistic, documentary and material analyses and essays continue to assess foundational knowledge and historical/archaeological/linguistic skills. They also require students to put these skills to new uses by formulating arguments and applying their communicative and analytical skills creatively in a broader context. Final examinations provide a summative assessment of command over unit content.\nThis assessment regime encourages and rewards regular and systematic learning. Specific assessments also foster independent investigation, the development of research skills, and reflection on the significance of historical features and themes for the study of relevant ancient cultures. To this end, regular practice and revision of knowledge and skills are crucial. The course deploys early low-risk assessments, major research-based assessments, and final overview assessments.",

Summative assessment is used to evaluate your performance against a set of clearly defined standards.\nAll units in the degree involve summative assessment from which final grades are obtained, but many will also offer extensive formative assessment - that is you will receive feedback that should help you identify areas of strength and weakness thereby giving you the opportunity to improve your performance in subsequent tasks. Formative feedback may take the form of nested assessment tasks, peer reviewed activities, and skill practice which, in combination with a more substantial summative assessment such as a longer assignment or examination, provide a set of results that allow for your final grade to be calculated.\nIn each unit of study details will be provided to clearly explain what is assessed, how it will be assessed and the weighting of each task. The standards and criteria associated with each assessment task will be advertised along with the detailed instructions for task completion.\nAssessment tasks may involve:\n<ul>\n<li>Writing essays, critical reviews and research reports of various lengths and complexity</li>\n<li>Posting blogs or participating in other kinds of online activities</li>\n<li>Conducting laboratory language data analysis</li>\n<li>Giving tutorial and seminar presentations (group and/or individual)</li>\n<li>Participating in tutorial/seminar activities and in-class discussions</li>\n<li>Describing language data using established theory-driven techniques</li>\n<li>conducting independent or collaborative research projects using language data to explore interesting theoretical questions</li>\n<li>Participating in exams, class tests and online quizzes.</li>\n</ul>\nThe Capstone unit, SPHL3300 Language as Evidence, is the culmination of your study in the Bachelor of Speech and Hearing Sciences degree.\nIn the capstone unit, the main assessment task will involve you designing and reporting on a small language research project in an area where your main interests and expertise lie. The task is developmentally scaffolded through a set of formative assessment tasks designed to inform your major project and a class presentation.",

All learning activities are supported by an online presence that facilitates web-based group discussion/blogging, communication between staff and students, as well as easy access to multimedia resources and assessment materials.\nLive and recorded lectures and presentations are complemented by smaller group tutorial and workshop sessions along with independent reading and engagement with learning materials.\nLecture format may be used to present important concepts in a didactic way while at the same time providing opportunities for students to interact with senior teaching staff in a large-group forum. Most lectures are recorded for student convenience and are structured with additional small-group activities and targeted self-study activities in mind.\nSmall group activities consolidate materials presented in more formal settings and encourage further independent and collaborative exploration of concepts and ideas. In small groups you will learn to critically appraise relevant literature, make evidence based arguments, give and receive feedback, communicate using a range of media, work as part of a team, conduct small research projects, analyse data, and behave ethically.\nAcquisition of skills essential to speech and hearing science and linguistics is fundamental to the course. Skill development occurs in a supportive and collaborative environment facilitated through the small group format by providing opportunities for group discussion, problem-based learning, focus on analysis techniques, and skills practice. Skill acquisition requires structured experiences with real-world language problems and data collected from a variety of sources. These include direct observations of language and text-based corpora through to physiological and acoustic data captured by state-of-the-art equipment. Laboratory analyses and experiences reinforce the importance of evidence-driven practice and help consolidate concept development through hands-on exploration of data.\nThe course has its foundations in research-based theory and practice and therefore research is integrated into every stage of the course. You will be involved in observing, collecting, analysing language data and presenting your findings using a variety of media. You will also be involved in the research-rich culture of the Linguistics Department through participation opportunities with research projects being conducted by staff and higher degree research students.

Students are given multiple opportunities in each unit throughout the course to develop comprehension and communication strategies that will assist them in attaining the overall course learning outcomes. Assessment tasks require students to engage with theoretical concepts and express themselves appropriately according to the context and medium whether in their target language studies or in International Studies units. In the latter, students are required to undertake independent research and to demonstrate their knowledge, analytical skills and critical thinking.\nIn addition students demonstrate their growing knowledge of the structural aspects of their target language and the cultural contexts in which communication occurs within the cultures which employ the target language. The emphasis is on formative tasks with meaningful applications, such as spoken and written tasks relating to students' lives, opinions and their engagement with the broader language communities, however some summative tasks such as grammar and vocabulary quizzes are incorporated, particularly at 1000 and 2000 levels, so that students can confirm minimum attainment of key structural aspects of the language. All student work is evaluated according to standards that are clearly articulated within the unit, and no norm-referencing is used. International Studies units employ moderation procedures between multiple markers involved in a single unit and external moderation for units with a single marker.\nExamples of assessment types include:\n<ul>\n<li>Quiz</li>\n<li>Essay</li>\n<li>Online discussion - written</li>\n<li>Participation</li>\n<li>Literature review</li>\n<li>Presentation</li>\n<li>Formal Exams</li>\n</ul>",

Students of the Bachelor of International Studies have opportunities to include in-country studies such as intensive residential units and PACE International activities in their degree in addition to a required semester of in-country study in country in which their target language is spoken.\nLearning and teaching International Studies content (non-language) units at the 1000 level incorporate a variety of methods and a range of subjects to enable students to develop knowledge and learn concepts of cross-cultural communication, and to identify, respect and respond appropriately to the norms of a broad range of cultures, and to apply these in program outcomes. Students have opportunities to undertake intensive residential in-country studies internship, a domestic internship and/or PACE International activity in their degree.\nLearning and teaching in 2000 and 3000 level Internationals Studies units facilitate independent research in topics such as citizenship studies, regional studies, intercultural communication, global politics and globalisation, identity, culture transition and transmission, and diaspora studies. At 3000 level, students in the Bachelor of International Studies undertaken a session of in-country studies where they apply their language skills towards social and academic purposes in an international context, and in the capstone unit they examine and reflect on the role of the target language in its cultural and societal setting, and evaluate this role in local and global situations.\nLanguage units undertaken as a core component of the Bachelor of International Studies use a communicative approach in the classroom environment with additional audio and written material and activities to be worked on at home. The emphasis inside and outside of the classroom is on meaningful interaction and tasks, and the creation of a low anxiety environment which fosters the development of a learning community in which students can practice their target language. This is supported by a range of comprehensible inputs targeted at the students' developing language level, both from teaching staff and support materials (principally online), and constant opportunities for students to apply their developing knowledge to meaningful tasks. These include reading and listening to authentic cultural materials, in which students are guided to develop comprehension strategies that can be applied to any situation, and to acquire vocabulary in context. In support of the communicative goals, students also review key grammatical concepts to build their confidence and capacity to evaluate their own progress in the discipline. As students' progress into 2000 and 3000 level units, they also engage in tasks and enrol in units with a stronger emphasis on cognitive and analytical skills in addition to language proficiency, including conducting research related to target language cultures and presenting it in a variety of formats such as oral presentations and written and spoken discussions, essays, debates, and audio-visual recordings. Language teaching models include: practicals, seminars, lectures, tutorials, and supervised independent study.",

While lectures in this course are typically delivered in the traditional face-to-face mode, extensive use is also made of the Echo 360 lecture recording system. Many lectures, where technically possible, are also video captured. </li>\n<li>Tutorials: classes in which a tutor facilitates interactive learning with a small group of students. At the 1000 level, tutorials tend to focus on ensuring that fundamental concepts and skills are acquired. As students progress to 2000 and 3000 level, the focus of tutorials shifts towards a more critical engagement with the discipline. Tutorials provide students with the chance to ask questions, seek clarification, resolve problems, practice communication skills and develop their ability to work in a collaborative manner with others.</li>\n<li>Workshops: the environment in which BEc graduates will work is one requiring high level quantitative skills. These quantitative skills are developed, in part, in computer lab workshop sessions. In addition to formal workshop sessions under the direct instruction of a lecturer or tutor, students are able to access these computer labs to practice skills and to complete assessment tasks outside formal class time. </li>\n<li>Participation and Community Engagement (PACE). The BEc aims to produce work ready graduates. To this end all students complete a Capstone unit in their final year of study, which draws together the various strands of knowledge that have been developed across the course and emphasises the application of this knowledge to real world situations. The Capstone also includes an emphasis on PACE. This takes the form of sustained serious engagement with industry partners. These industry partners present lectures in which real world projects are posed to students. Students work on these projects in groups, under close supervision from lecturing staff and the industry partners.</li>\n</ul>",

Formative assessment provides students with feedback on their learning, but is sometimes not graded, or makes a small contribution to the final grade. Summative assessment gives students a judgement on their learning, for grading purposes.\nThe types of assessment tasks employed in the MCom are diverse.\n<ul>\n<li>Essays: an essay requires the systematic investigation of a topic and the development of a written argument. In addition to assessing the acquisition of discipline specific knowledge and skills, essays are also used to assess other program objectives relating to cognitive, communication and research skills. Essays in the MCom tend to be between 1500 and 3000 words in length. </li>\n<li>Independent Research Projects: some units in the MCom include a substantial independent research project. </li>\n<li>Assignments: an assignment may take a variety of formats ranging from the production of an Excel spreadsheet, the analysis of data, a written response to a topic question, or presenting a solution to an analytical problem. </li>\n<li>Quizzes: a quiz is an offline or online assessment. In the MCom, quizzes are typically used to assess discipline specific knowledge and skills. Quizzes usually consist of a short series of questions requiring a brief response. They also commonly take the form of multiple choice questions. Quizzes are used widely across the program. They provide timely, formative feedback to students.</li>\n<li>Presentations: presentations may be conducted on an individual or group basis. They involve the oral description of an area of investigation and may utilise a range of presentation technologies and supplementary materials such as handouts. Presentations typically provide the audience with the opportunity to ask questions. The presenter(s) is expected to provide an informed response. This form of assessment is crucial in the development of the important program objectives relating to communication. Feedback is typically (but not always) provided verbally and in writing. Feedback from peers is also sometimes provided.</li>\n<li>Class participation: class participation is assessed by a student's engagement in discussions facilitated by a lecturer, contributions to online discussion forums, or general questions asked during lectures and seminars. Participation is expected to be well considered and relevant to the topic. Participation is also linked to attendance &ndash; it a student is not present, they can not participate.</li>\n<li>Final examination: the final examination is designed to assess a student's body of knowledge and critical thinking skills. Examinations consist of questions requiring written responses. These questions may be in a multiple choice format, or require short answers or short essay responses. Most units in the MCom have a final examination. The final examination is typically given the heaviest weighting in the assessment scheme.</li>\n</ul>",

They cover information relevant to succeeding in the workplace, such as adapting to a new office environment, business communication, business ethics, reflection for further learning, soft skill development and translating placement experiences into materials relevant for future job searches.</li>\n<li>Online modules support students to engage with topics relevant to succeeding and learning from their placement experience (e.g., project management or leadership). The modules are designed to introduce a topic and provide a structure for students to apply what they are learning about the topic through the experience of the placement.</li>\n<li>Vocational placements in the Professional Practice component of the double degree involve an extensive period of training in a workplace setting. Students work on practical problems under the guidance of a supervisor. The staggered sequence of three vocational placements allows students to apply knowledge and skills developed in the classroom to new and authentic workplace experiences over the course of their course. Workshops and online curriculum support and enable students to reflect on and articulate how &ldquo;theory and practice&rdquo; work together, enhancing students&rsquo; capacity for life-long, self-directed learning. The sequence of vocational placements also offers students the opportunity to explore a range of career options for their discipline and different types of firms and network with potential employers.</li>\n</ul>",

Carefully scaffolded and sequenced assessment tasks are a feature (including low-risk activities, encouraging regular practice and reinforcement of knowledge and skills and their integrated application. Modified development of content across assessments is also important to this program's methodology, with a view to systematic development of control over the learning outcomes.\nThe assessment regime is designed to account for both assessment of learning and assessment for learning. In-class or online quizzes periodically test student control over foundational knowledge and skills. Evidence-based oral and/or written exercises provide both a process by which students can learn to integrate the foundational knowledge and skills and an opportunity to assess their competency in this area. Textual, documentary and material analyses and essays continue to assess foundational knowledge and historical skills. They also require students to put these skills to new uses by formulating arguments and applying their communicative and analytical skills creatively in a broader context. Final examinations are not normally required: they may be utilized (eg in language units) to provide a summative assessment of command over unit content.\nNaturally enough, this assessment regime encourages and rewards regular and systematic learning. Specific assessments also foster independent investigation, the development of research skills, and reflection on the significance of historical features and themes for the study of relevant ancient cultures. To this end, regular practice and revision of knowledge and skills are crucial. The program deploys early low-risk assessments, major research-based assessments, and final overview-assessments.",

The types of assessments used align to course learning outcomes and the roles, activities and task that would be expected of graduate destinations. Students will receive feedback to help guide them while working on tasks (formative feedback) and on completion of tasks (summative feedback) to enable development. Feedback will be in a variety of forms including feedback for individual students and feedback directed to the entire cohort. Provision of feedback maybe in written and/or verbal form.\nThe assessments aims to evaluate students understanding and knowledge of concepts, laboratory competencies and communication skills and develop leadership ability. Assessment within the Bachelor of Medical Sciences embeds the diverse communication modalities required in the field (scientific reports, literature reviews, scientific posters, debates, and oral presentations) and enables capabilities associated with knowledge, understanding and synthesis to be assessed. Other forms of assessment relate to laboratory skills and competencies such as equipment use, data analysis and safety, and research and problem solving capabilities including experimental design and data interpretation.",

In the majors, students will build on their core learnings of knowledge, concepts and laboratory skills through the gradual introduction of more difficult concepts and procedures at each level of the Degree.\nStudents will learn through a combination of lectures, practical classes and small-group classes that cover weekly themes. Lectures introduce knowledge and concepts, which are further explored through enquiry-based learning in practical classes. Activities in practical classes reflect real world applications that students investigate using research-led activities. Learning encompasses strong medical and health research themes and students will frequently design and perform small experiments, analyse and interpret data and use this information to prepare assessments using modes of communication common in the sciences. Concepts, techniques and problem-based tasks are further explored in lectorials that comprise a mini-lecture followed by student-led collaborative activities that aim to encourage independent learning.\nLearning activities will include acquiring and synthesising information from a range of sources including scientific journal articles and health agency websites; practising skills such as laboratory techniques and a wide-range of communication tasks to achieve competency; and working collaboratively with students on learning activities. Students will also learn how to work in a safe and ethical manner.\nStudents will have the opportunity to develop communication skills using appropriate forms to effectively reach a wide-range of people including scientists, patients and the community. Opportunities to further develop communication skills are presented through participation in health events and community outreach activities.\nAn important component of this degree are the numerous opportunities to connect with future employment areas. Students will hear from medical and health industry professionals and recent program graduates as soon as they begin university. The early integration of industry professionals will contextualise the learning activities of the program. In the final year of study students undertake a work-based learning activity as part of the University's Professional and Community Engagement (PACE) initiative. The PACE unit will enable opportunities for group-based, industry-focused placements within potential employment areas that may span government organisations, laboratories, allied health, and biotechnology companies.",

Some units utilise small groups where students work in a team to achieve a goal. Communication skills are developed through oral presentations and teamwork. Engineering practice skills are developed across the course in a variety of activities including teamwork, discussion mode and report/documentation writing activities.\nThe theoretical components of units develop the underlying principles, along with analytical and problem-solving skills using a combination of lectures, tutorials and online learning resources. All units have weekly face-to-face activities. Assignments are used for formative and summative purposes. As knowledge in engineering is continually evolving, learning and teaching methods support the capacity for students to become independent life-long learners.\nThe course also features a coherent set of professional engineering units that span your entire experience at Macquarie and is a common touchpoint for all students. Through these units, you will have a scaffolded experience that builds your skills before applying them to a complex multi-disciplinary project and finishes with a review of professional engineering practice before you step into the workforce.\nThe Engineering course culminates in the final year with students doing a dedicated research thesis project that develops skills and knowledge of research principles and methods. This can be either in an in-house setting with a primary academic supervisor or externally to the university in a company or research organisation setting with a primary industry supervisor supported by an academic supervisor. The project allows students to apply, in an integrated manner, the knowledge and skills they have developed in their studies to a substantial engineering design, analysis or research problem.",

You are encouraged, through independent, peer review and group activities, to identify, analyse and solve major skill development problems you have experienced in your practice by drawing on the feedback, suggestions and recommendations provided by your instructors on a weekly basis.\nSince interpreting practice is underpinned by a sound knowledge of the theories and research that have informed current views of practice, you will be exposed to a variety of specially designed teaching and learning tasks. These tasks will include research activities ranging from reading, information gathering, data analysis, self-reflection in and on your own conference interpreting practice, and report writing. You will be encouraged to apply linguistic and extra-linguistic skills and knowledge to investigate, analyse, interpret and synthesize complex information, practical problems and theoretical concepts in relation to conference interpreting.\nIn addition to class or/and booth-based practice, you are required to regularly reflect on your own performance and keep a reflective journal and a portfolio containing information as to what, how and why you have prepared for your learning.\nThis course is a student-centred learning program, structured to promote the life-long learning philosophy. So, great importance is attached to fostering your abilities through larger research projects to initiate, plan, implement, evaluate and improve your conference interpreting-related skills, strategies and knowledge.

        "learningMethods": "The study of International Relations is based on critique and reflection as a basis for action. Its subject matter is inherently contested: thinkers across the ages and practitioners in the current age have conflicting views of what is possible and desirable in relations between states and peoples. Learning in the course is designed to promote a deep understanding of conflicting perspectives and abilities to espouse and, as far as possible, execute choices that are rational, ethical, and effective in a world of conflict.\nThe activities that students undertake in the course are related to the thoughts and actions of others. Reading diverse materials in many different formats, interaction with faculty and peers, both digitally and face-to-face, and observation are activities that feed reflection. Active engagement with faculty and peers is equally promoted in online and on-campus lectures and in other interactive modes that allow questions and testing in modes that may involve two or many other people. Methods employed include discussion, both structured and spontaneous (under moderation), debate, simulations and role play, panel decision-making, journalling and peer review and feedback. In seminars and fieldwork exercises, student engagement is essential for structured discussion and the collaborative consideration of the core principles and points of contention in international relations.\nStudents in the course typically come from very diverse nationalities and cross-learning is critically important, in an atmosphere of mutual respect and trust. The course treats students as adult learners who are mastering the techniques of study, analysis and argumentative deployment through reflexivity and praxis: an individual&rsquo;s sense of capacity is developed in relation to the values of others and tested in interaction with them, some as individuals directly experienced (staff, guest lecturers, peers) and others as found in the texts and debates, both historical and current, of the global arena.\nLearning and teaching strategies include:\n<ul>\n<li>Openness to a variety of teaching and assessment formats that engage diverse learning styles and encourage student participation, discussion, and collaboration.</li>\n<li>Timely feedback on all assignments and where necessary individual tuition to address assessed weaknesses in performance.</li>\n<li>An emphasis on elucidating the ethical dimensions of decision making in the world of global politics, drawing conclusions as appropriate for new or differing approaches to policy making and execution in international relations.</li>\n<li>The use of case studies drawn from historical and contemporary times that illuminate key themes in the emerging global society.</li>\n<li>Where possible, attendance or observation of significant incidents in thinking about international relations, as in seminars off campus by visiting scholars, activists and elected officials from national governments and international organisations.</li>\n<li>Lectures: lectures are delivered face to face in day and evening mode and also digitally and may be in one or two hour format or in shorter sessions interspersed with discussion and structured analysis. Faculty members deliver most lectures, but guest lecturers cover some topics where specialist expertise is required.</li>\n<li>Seminars: seminars allow for the interactive discussion of topics at an enhanced level and may include attendance and participation in seminars beyond the formal reach of the course, as in work in progress seminars by faculty members and visiting scholars.</li>\n<li>Learning technologies: throughout all activities of the course, attention is paid to the introduction of new or modified learning technologies based on the University&rsquo;s strong commitment to the ongoing learning of its own faculty as reflected in the professional development programs offered on campus every year. Recent modifications include the intensification of the &lsquo;flipped classroom&rsquo; mode and the use of video in on-line delivery.</li>\n</ul>",

Clear standards and criteria for these assessments, for what is assessed and how it is assessed, are contained in each unit guide. Some of the practical assessments may be done in part or wholly by other students as peer assessment, and you will also be guided towards improved self-assessment as this is an essential professional skill for translators and interpreters.\nThe practical component of the coursework constitutes approximately half of the full course, and this weight is also reflected in the assessment in the course. In the first instance, self- and peer-assessment will form an important part of the practical tutorials. The tasks you will be required to complete in these tutorials will also be assessed formatively during the tutorials by lecturers and or tutors, as well as summatively in longer assignments, tests and examinations. In isolated practical units, the summative assessment will also comply with NAATI requirements for accreditation (application for NAATI accreditation remains an individual choice for students).\nThe theoretical and analytical component of the coursework will be assessed formatively in shorter written assessments in the theoretical units but also as analytical assessments in the practical units. This component will also form a substantial part of the summative assessment in the course.\nFinally, the research component of the coursework will be assessed mainly summatively in substantial independent research projects in one of the theory units as well as in one of the practical units in the final session.\nDuring the final session of the course, there will be major summative assessments in terms of research methodology and independent research. In the case of research methodology, students will complete a smaller number of formative assessments, before producing a research proposal as summative assessment. In the case of independent research, students will be required to produce longer research reports in two specific units that will constitute fifty per cent of the assessments for those units. In the same semester, students will also be assessed formatively in terms of professional practice through the compilation of a portfolio of practical assignments.",

The tasks you will be required to complete in these tutorials will also be assessed formatively during the tutorials by lecturers and or tutors, as well as summatively in longer assignments, tests and examinations. In isolated practical units, the summative assessment will also comply with NAATI requirements for accreditation (application for NAATI accreditation remains an individual choice for students).\nThe theoretical and analytical component of the coursework will be assessed formatively in shorter written assessments in the theoretical units but also as analytical assessments in the practical units. This component will also form a substantial part of the summative assessment in the course.\nStudents will also be assessed formatively in terms of professional practice through the compilation of a portfolio of practical assignments.\nDuring the final session of thecourse, there will be major summative assessments in terms of research methodology and independent research. In the case of research methodology, students will complete a smaller number of formative assessments, before producing a research proposal as summative assessment.

The methods used across the program (not in everyunit) may be summarized as follows:\u2022 Tests on ancient language grammar and syntax assess foundational knowledge and skills.\u2022 Online tutorial participation (incorporating directed discussion of questions set for online forum) as well as individual and/or group presentations assess the integration of foundational knowledge and skills.\u2022 Evidence-based analyses and essays test not only the integration offoundational knowledge and skills, but also foster the creative application of historical skills and analysis of ancient cultures.\u2022 Final examinations allow students to demonstrate their overall command of unit content.\nAssessment tasks are carefully graduated to guide and focus engagement with the learningoutcomes. Carefully scaffolded and sequenced assessment tasks are a feature (including low-risk activities, encouraging regular practice and reinforcement of knowledge and skills and their integrated application. Modified development of content across assessments is also important to this program's methodology, with a view to systematic development of control over the learning outcomes.\nThe assessment regime is designed to account for both assessment of learning and assessment for learning. Online quizzes periodically test student control over foundational knowledge and skills. Evidence-based written exercises provide both a process by which students can learn to integrate the foundational knowledge and skills and an opportunity to assess their competency in this area. Textual, documentary and material analyses and essays continue to assess foundational knowledge and historical skills. They also require students to put these skills to new uses by formulating arguments and applying their communicative and analytical skills creatively in a broader context. Final examinations are not normally required: they may be utilized (eg in language units) to provide a summative assessment of command over unit content.\nNaturally enough, this assessment regime encourages and rewards regular and systematic learning. Specific assessments also foster independent investigation, the development of research skills, and reflection on the significance of historical features and themes for the study of relevant ancient cultures. To this end, regular practice and revision of knowledge and skills are crucial. The program deploys early low-risk assessments, major research-based assessments, and final overview-assessments.",

Assessment tasks are intended both to measure individual progress and provide you with information and guidance on your development.\nOur assessments are designed not only to test students' discipline-specific knowledge and skills but also their ability to integrate and analyse information to solve real-world problems. Assessments are spread throughout semester to enable students to build confidence and gain feedback as they learn. In addition to formal assessments, students are provided with regular informal feedback on their progress. This is done through activities that involve self- and peer-evaluation, as well as through our strong student support system of tutors and academic advisors.\nAssessment types used include (but are not limited to) problem solving, laboratory work and reports, oral presentations, essays, active participation in lectures and/or tutorials, online and in-class quizzes, individual and group projects and multi-media presentations (posters, videos, blogs). Formal examinations are part of the assessment of the majority of units and involve solving of problems appropriate for the scope and level of the unit.\nStandards and criteria for coursework, what is assessed and how it is assessed, are contained in each unit guide or may be made available via the university learning management system. Assessment is undertaken by academic staff, demonstrators and tutors. In some cases peer assessment will contribute to the grade. In some units, a component of the final grade will be determined by the assessment of work placement supervisors or guest lecturers.\nWhere group work is involved, a self-reflection and peer assessment/feedback in the form of contribution to the assessment task may be incorporated into the requirements of the assessment so that your individual contribution can be identified.",

Most of the units are comprised of three structured learning activities: lectures, tutorials and guided laboratory/practical exercises.\nLectures are where theoretical ideas and experimental and quantitative techniques are introduced and illustrated by a range of examples. They provide opportunities for discussion and active engagement, and as your studies progress will draw not only on textbooks and online learning materials, but involve exposure and interaction with current research.\nTutorials demonstrate concrete applications of techniques introduced in lectures, and also provide a training ground for students to apply their knowledge. Tutorials typically involve a mixture of individual and group work with guidance and assistance from the tutors.\nLaboratory and practical work is an indispensable part of a science education. You will acquire familiarity with experimental and/or computational methods and practices that both illustrate the theoretical concepts that are presented in lectures and facilitate development of practical research and application skills. These classes are the first setting where you learn to work collaboratively, and preparation of reports from practical exercises provides you with valuable training in communicating scientific results.\nWhere appropriate study includes field trips to locations at and around campus, the Sydney Basin, and further afield, as well as role-play scenarios and problem-solving in tutorial sessions.\nIn recognition that students learn via different means (i.e. visual, auditory, tactile), many of our units take advantage of a diversity of media for their delivery (e.g. videos, lectures, readings, activities). Our philosophy is that students learn by doing and we endeavour to make our units as hands-on as possible.\nMastering effective communication is a major component of all learning activities. Apart from the reports and problem-solving assignments you will prepare oral and written presentations and/or essays of your research and study projects.\nFrom the first year you will be engaged in a collaborative work, both in tutorials and laboratories. With your study progression you become exposed to less structured activities, such as individual or group-based research projects, and formal and informal presentations. There are many instances of blended learning activities, including a combination of online and face-to-face modes, or group and/or one-to-one activities are combined.\nA feature of Macquarie University degrees is the inclusion of work-integrated learning in the form of the nationally-recognised PACE (Professional and Community Engagement) units. During your study you will take one of the designated PACE units, which provides opportunity for Work Integrated Learning\nToward the end of the program the Capstone unit of study allows you to integrate your skills and knowledge, applied to real-life problems.",

Assessment tasks are intended both to measure individual progress and provide you with information and guidance on your development.\nOur assessments are designed not only to test students' discipline-specific knowledge and skills, but also their ability to integrate and analyse information to solve real-world problems. Assessments are spread throughout semester to enable students to build confidence and gain feedback as they learn. In addition to formal assessments, students are provided with regular informal feedback on their progress. This is done through activities that involve self- and peer-evaluation, as well as through our strong student support system of tutors and academic advisors.\nAssessment types used include (but are not limited to) problem solving, laboratory work and reports, oral presentations, essays, active participation in lectures and/or tutorials, online quizzes, individual and group projects and multi-media presentations (posters, videos, blogs). Formal examinations are part of the assessment of the majority of units and involve solving of problems appropriate for the scope and level of the unit.\nStandards and criteria for coursework, what is assessed and how it is assessed, are contained in each unit guide or may be made available via the university learning management system. Assessment is undertaken by academic staff, demonstrators and tutors. In some cases peer assessment will contribute to the grade.\nWhere group work is involved, a self-reflection and peer assessment/feedback in the form of contribution to the assessment task may be incorporated into the requirements of the assessment so that your individual contribution can be identified.",

        "learningMethods": "In this course you will build your knowledge and skills in the experimental, technical and theoretical aspects of your chosen discipline and develop understanding of its methodology, relationship with other disciplines and practical applications. Most of the units are comprised of three structured learning activities: online lectures, tutorials and guided laboratory/practical exercises.\nOnline lectures are where theoretical ideas and experimental and quantitative techniques are introduced and illustrated by a range of examples. They provide opportunities for active engagement, and as your studies progress, will draw not only on textbooks and online learning materials, but involve exposure and interaction with current research.\nTutorials demonstrate concrete applications of techniques introduced in online lectures, and also provide a training ground for students to apply their knowledge. Tutorials typically involve a mixture of individual and group work with guidance and assistance from the tutors.\nLaboratory and practical work is an indispensable part of a science education. You will acquire familiarity with experimental and/or computational methods and practices that both illustrate the theoretical concepts that are presented in online lectures, and facilitate development of practical research and application skills. Preparation of reports from practical exercises provides you with valuable training in communicating scientific results.\nIn recognition that students learn via different means (i.e. visual, auditory, tactile), many of our units take advantage of a diversity of media for their delivery (e.g. videos, readings, online activities). Our philosophy is that students learn by doing and we endeavour to make our units as hands-on as possible.\nMastering effective communication is a major component of all learning activities. Apart from the reports and problem-solving assignments, you will prepare oral and written presentations and/or essays of your research and study projects.\nFrom the first year you will be engaged in a collaborative work, both in tutorials and laboratories. With your study progression, you become exposed to less structured activities, such as individual or group-based research projects, and formal and informal presentations. There are many instances of blended learning activities, including a combination of online and face-to-face modes, or group and/or one-to-one activities are combined.\nToward the end of the program the Capstone unit of study allows you to integrate your skills and knowledge, applied to real-life problems.",
