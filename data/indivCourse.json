    "assessment": "<p>Most units in the program include regular tutorial exercises which are designed for students to test their own understanding. These are formative and are not assessed. There are also a range of assessment tasks which are used to determine students' grades.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Final Exam: this program is accredited by the Actuaries Institute, the Australian professional actuarial body. To assist in meeting accreditation requirements, many units in the program have an assessment scheme strongly weighted towards a final exam. A unit's final examination is designed to assess a student's command of the entire unit's knowledge and skills. While multiple choice questions are used in some units, most exam questions require longer written answers, which may be either mathematical in nature or word-based. Actuaries do not work in isolation but rather need to be able to explain their results to members of other professions, so exam questions do include scenarios requiring non-technical explanations of the meaning of calculations.</li>\n<li>Tests: class tests are held during class time under normal exam conditions. They allow students to practice their exam skills in preparation for the final exam.</li>\n<li>Assignments: an assignment may take a variety of formats such as the analysis of data using a spreadsheet or statistical software, the development of a mathematical argument, or the production of a formal report explaining the results of any of the previous items.</li>\n<li>Quizzes: a quiz is an online assessment. Quizzes usually consist of a short series of questions which may be true/false, multiple choice, or require students to enter a numerical answer. Quizzes are usually computer-marked, their main advantage being their ability to provide fast feedback to students.</li>\n<li>Presentations: presentations may be conducted on an individual or group basis. Traditionally they have involved a live oral presentation with appropriate visual aids, but looking forward they may allow students to develop a video presentation.</li>\n</ul>",

This is particularly so in the course's capstone unit, which is also a PACE (Participation and Community Engagement) unit.
